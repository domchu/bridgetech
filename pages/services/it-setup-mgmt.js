                      IT setup and management refer to the processes and
                      activities involved in designing, implementing, and
                      maintaining an organization's information technology
                      infrastructure and systems. It encompasses the planning,
                      deployment, configuration, monitoring, and support of
                      hardware, software, networks, and associated resources to
                      meet the organization's technological needs. IT setup
                      involves the initial design and implementation of the IT
                      infrastructure. This includes procuring and configuring
                      hardware components (servers, workstations, networking
                      equipment), selecting and installing software
                      applications, establishing network connectivity, and
                      ensuring proper integration and compatibility between
                      different systems and devices. The setup phase also
                      involves defining user access, permissions, security
                      protocols, and data storage solutions.

                        The first step is to assess the specific requirements of

                        operating systems, productivity software, security
